# ScrapGod

### An additional tool for Beautiful Soup

I love [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/), but it often takes some time to get the results I want. I tried to find a way to visualize the HTML file as I was parsing through it, simply to make scraping easier.

I coded using Python, and pyQt for the GUI. I built ScrapGod on top of the Beautiful Soup library.

ScrapGod provides a real-time display of the results as we isolate the data we’re looking for.
It can also, in some cases, put that data in a dataset and export it in CSV or JSON.

Anyone is more than welcome to join in to improve the code.
I’d still like to add an efficient context menu for each tab and a QFileDialog window when exporting a dataset.
